Welcome to the **MERN Stack Boilerplate** repository! This project provides a solid foundation for full-stack web development using the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The goal is to simplify your development process and help you build powerful web applications with JavaScript.

## Introduction

The MERN stack combines four powerful technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, designed for building APIs and web applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, allowing you to run JavaScript on the server.

Using these technologies together allows developers to write both client-side and server-side code in JavaScript, streamlining the development process.

## Features

- **Full-Stack Development**: Easily build both front-end and back-end applications.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure your application with JSON Web Tokens.
- **Redux State Management**: Manage application state effectively with Redux.
- **Responsive Design**: Create applications that work on any device.
- **RESTful API**: Develop a robust API using Express.js.
- **Modular Structure**: Keep your code organized and maintainable.

## Getting Started

To get started with this boilerplate, you will need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Follow the steps below to set up your environment.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bruno13585/mern.git
   cd mern
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   For the server:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

   For the client:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the server directory and add your MongoDB connection string and any other necessary configurations.

   ```plaintext
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:

   Start the server:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

   Start the client:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once your application is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`. The client will communicate with the server, allowing you to perform CRUD operations.
